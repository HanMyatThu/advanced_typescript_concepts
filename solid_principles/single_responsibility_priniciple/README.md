## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

This means that a class should only have one responsibility or job. If a class has more than one responsibility, it has more than one reason to change, which can make it more complex and difficult to maintain. This principle promotes cohesion in classes and reduces the likelihood of brittle code that can break in unexpected ways when changes are made.
